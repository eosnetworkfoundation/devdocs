## Description

The `wallet_api_plugin` exposes functionality from the [`wallet_plugin`](../wallet_plugin/index.md) to the RPC API interface managed by the [`http_plugin`](../../../01_nodeos/03_plugins/http_plugin/index.md).

:::caution Caution

This plugin exposes wallets. Therefore, running this plugin on a publicly accessible node is not recommended. As of 1.2.0, the `wallet_api_plugin` is only available through `keosd`. It is no longer supported by `nodeos`.

:::

## Usage

:::info Default address:port

If no optional arguments are used (i.e. `--url` or `--wallet-url`), `cleos` attempts to connect to a local `nodeos` or `keosd` running at localhost `127.0.0.1` and default port `8888`.

:::

* You can also create a JSON snippet that uses clear text JSON for `data` field.

:::info

Be aware that if a clear text `data` field is used, cleos need to fetch copies of required ABIs using `nodeos` API. That operation has a performance overhead on `nodeos`

The steps here can be readily expanded for the networked case. Some assumptions are made here regarding how the parties involved will coordinate with each other. However, there are many ways that the community can choose to coordinate. The technical aspects of the process are objective; assumptions of how the coordination might occur are speculative. Several approaches have already been suggested by the community. You are encouraged to review the various approaches and get involved in the discussions as appropriate.
