# How To Run Tests

Quick guide.
```
cd docsgen/testing
./run_test.sh
```

## What
We run `Cypress`. The tests are in `testing/cypress/e2e/devtools_simple_spec.cy.js`

## Why
Docusaurus is a single page app, we need a headless browser to evaluate the DOM.

## Configuration

By default `http://localhost:3000` is running to test against.

```
cd $BUILD_DIR/devdocs
npm run serve -- --port 3000
```

The host and http protocol is configurable by changing `testing/cypress.config.js`. In addition, the contracts repository differs between ENF and AntelopeIO organizations. The name of the contracts repository is also set in `testing/cypress.config.js`
